# QLearningAlgorithmWithAimsun
This is a AI based traffic control project. The aim of this project is to control traffic lights with Q-Learning Algorithm over Aimsun (Traffic Simulation Program). That's way the project connected to Aimsun API in main class and we can give order to Aimsun program with that. By the way, We used Aimsun Next for that because it is the only version of program in order to support API. Some of the footages that were taken from the simulation environment has been shared below.



Ultimately, This project is my both thesis project and TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) supported project (2209-A).

Make fun with power of AI in traffic :)
